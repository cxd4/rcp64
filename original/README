zilmar's "common plugin specifications" defined four types of plug-ins:

#define PLUGIN_TYPE_RSP        1
#define PLUGIN_TYPE_GFX        2
#define PLUGIN_TYPE_AUDIO      3
#define PLUGIN_TYPE_CONTROLLER 4

Since before releasing Project64, he revised each of these common definitions
to at least version 1.1, updating the system through which different emulators
will read and initialize the plug-ins of any type.

Some files were corrected in slight ways not affecting the code shortly after
the actual date of release, but the month always held the same.  Upon the death
of the year 2001, zilmar discontinued Project64 at version 1.4 and any new
development of his plug-in specifications.
